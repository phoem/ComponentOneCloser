# Component One Popup Closer
This was a project I had created at an old job.  Our company used ComponentOne dlls in our projects, however
we only had the trial or developer versions of the dlls on our development machines.  The server where we built our
software contained the proper license file that we paid for, but during development each time I would compile the
project on my desktop during development and testing, I would end up with about 6 popup windows that had to be pressed
in order for compiling to continue.  This became VERY tedious, so I decided to write this quick software to speed up my
development workflow.

# IMPORTANT
I want to be VERY clear, I do not condone software piracy.  I only condone getting rid of the nag screens in this
situation where the license is already paid for by the company, but since development is done on a different machine
the nag screen occurs.
